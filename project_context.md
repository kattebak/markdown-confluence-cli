- Shortcut on error conditions, exit early, avoid the else statement
- Use minimal, focused implementations
- do not use any type
- use types from the libraries
- do not shadow types
- do not create many custom types
- use unknown type or assertions
- Avoid verbose code that doesn't directly contribute to the solution
- Don't add features or methods that aren't used or nessecary
- Keep it DRY.
- Use "for..of" loops instead of forEach
- don't cast to any. don't use any. any is forbidden
- Frontload IO, reading files, parsing things before application logic
- Prioritize actionable functionality over explanatory code
- **Only use try-catch when you intend to recover from the error**
- If you're just logging and re-throwing, use promise chaining instead
- Let errors bubble up naturally unless you have specific recovery logic
- **Don't write usage examples in code comments**
- **Don't create test files unless specifically requested**
- **Don't provide usage examples in responses unless asked**
- Keep code focused on implementation, not demonstration
- Don't say Perfect. don't say comprehensive.
- Most importantly, don't brag. We all know you're awesome
- DON't you EVER EDIT THIS FILE.
- Run npm fix to resolve formatting issues
